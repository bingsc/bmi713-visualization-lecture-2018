# Dataset

## National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS)

- Dataset produced by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commision
- Originally collection of consumer product-related injuries, since 2000 expanded to collect data on all injuries
- Collected at hospitals around the United States selected to represent as statistically valid sample of US population
- Data available from 1998 to 2017

## Preview

- __Lecture 7__
    - Learn how to visualize NEISS data
- __Lecture 8__
    - Compute common statistics on NEISS data
- __Lecture 10__ 
    - Cluster NEISS data to find patterns
- __Lecture 14__
    - Make a Shiny app to query and visualize NEISS data
  
## Group Exercise

1. Go to the NEISS website (Google is your best friend!)
1. Find the code book 
1. Look up some product codes that you find interesting
1. Create a ggplot that show the distribution of injuries caused by those products by month
1. Create a ggplot that show the distribution of injuries caused by those products by weekday
1. Stratify those distributions by sex
